# Guilds

Guilds provide a platform for players to come together and participate in cooperative events. They enable various activities, such as coordinated raids and challenges.

However, the guild feature is continuously evolving. Future updates will introduce additional mechanics like guild halls and [World Boss](/wiki/activities-and-challenges/world-bosses) spawning, enriching the gameplay experience even further.

### Levelling and Experience

Boosting the guild level through experience provides added benefits, such as expanding member capacity. Further enhancements are planned for future releases. As the guild level increases, you'll unlock additional raids and be able to participate in more daily challenges.

-----

### Marks

Marks are the currency earned through guild challenges. They allow access to various guild mechanics, such as refreshing challenges and participating in raids.

Currently, the sole method to acquire tokens is by completing challenges.

As a general rule of thumb, each challenge completed earns __1 point__. Refreshing a challenge costs __4 points__. The cost to start a raid varies based on its difficulty level.

### Member Limit

The guild member limit is dependent on the guilds total level.

| Member Limit | Guild Level |
| ----- | ----- |
| __20__ Members   | Lv. __1__ |
| __21__ Members | Lv. __35__ |
| __22__ Members | Lv. __60__ |
| __23__ Members | Lv. __70__ |
| __24__ Members | Lv. __85__ |

### Stockpile

The guild stockpile is a dedicated pool of resources that can only be used for the guild hall and its components. Unlike a bank, once resources are contributed, they cannot be withdrawn. These resources are essential for maintaining and upgrading guild structures, such as repairing components of the guild hall.

>!!banner Trade locked characters cannot contribute to the guild stockpile.

-------

### Banished Guilds

Some character classes are intentionally cut off from the in-game market, which also locks them out of certain guild features tied to the economy - like the guild stockpile or challenge list.

To work around this, guild leaders can choose to "banish" their guild. When a guild is banished, only trade-locked (banished) characters can join. This gives those isolated classes access to guild features they normally wouldn’t be able to use.

The classes that are trade-locked are: **Banished**, **Cursed**.

>!!banner This is an irreversible decision. Once a guild is banished, it cannot be undone.
 
>!banner Only the guild leader can banish the guild.

>!banner A guild can only be banished if all members are trade-locked.

-------

### Additional Notes

>!banner A character can only join a guild once every 24 hours.
