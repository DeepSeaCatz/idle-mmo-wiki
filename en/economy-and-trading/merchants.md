### Guild Icons

Guild icons are a way for you to customise the icon of a guild that you are a leader of. 

>!banner Guild icons are exclusive to guilds where you hold the leadership position. 

>!banner If you transfer the guild leadership to another character, both the guild icon and background will reset since they are tied to the character's own personal collection.
