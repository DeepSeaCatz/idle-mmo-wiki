# Shooting Star

A shooting star is a special event that occurs randomly in the game. When a shooting star appears, active players in the game will be notified.

The goal is to search for the shooting star so that you can claim the limited time boost it offers. The boosts last for as long as the shooting star is active, which is typically around 30 to 60 minutes.

#### Activating the Shooting Star

To activate the shooting star, you must be at the location where the shooting star appears. Once you are there, you can press the "Nearby" button, and select the Shooting Star.

#### Shooting Star Boosts

The boosts that are provided by the shooting star are dependent on the day the shooting star appears. Each day has a different boost. It's important to keep this in mind when deciding whether to search for the shooting star or not.
