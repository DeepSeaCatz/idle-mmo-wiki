### How It Works

Players can create posts with titles and content, categorize them with tags, and engage with other players through comments and reactions. The Tavern serves as the main community discussion board where you can find tips, stories, trade offers, and guild recruitment posts.

### Tags

Comments support special formatting and tags.

#### Mentioning Players
Use `@username` to mention another player. They will receive a notification when mentioned.

#### Tagging Items
Use `[[Item Name]]` to link to items. This will display the item's icon and name with a clickable link.

For example:
- `@JohnDoe` will notify the player JohnDoe.
- `[[Iron Wood]]` will show the Iron Wood item with its icon.

>!banner There is a 1-minute cooldown between comments, with a limit of 10 comments per hour on a single post.
