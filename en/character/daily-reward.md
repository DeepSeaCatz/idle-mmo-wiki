# Daily Rewards

Daily rewards are a simple way to get free items and tokens just by logging in each day. The more days you claim in a row, the better your streak gets, which gives you some nice bonuses while you play.

## How It Works

The daily reward system resets every day at **12:00 UTC**. Once a new period starts, you can claim your reward for that day. You don't need to claim at exactly 12:00 UTC though. As long as you claim before the next reset, you're good.

The rewards cycle through a set pattern. Players get rewards for days 1 through 60.

When you claim your daily reward, you'll get either items or tokens. The specific reward depends on which day of the cycle you're on. Early days usually have smaller rewards, while later days in the cycle tend to give better rewards.

## Streaks

This is where things get interesting. Every time you claim a daily reward on consecutive days, your streak counter goes up by one. Miss a day? Your streak resets to zero and you start building it up again.

Keeping a streak going is worth it because you get magic find bonuses at certain milestones. These bonuses apply to battles, dungeons, and world bosses, making it more likely you'll find better loot.

## Streak Milestones

As your streak grows, you unlock magic find bonuses. These bonuses last until the next daily reset, so you need to keep your streak going to maintain them.

| Streak Days  | Magic Find Bonus | 
|--------------| ---------------- |
| **10 days**  | 1% |
| **20 days**  | 2% |
| **30 days**  | 3% |
| **40 days**  | 4% |
| **50 days**  | 5% |
| **60 days**  | 6% |
| **70 days**  | 7% |
| **80 days**  | 8% |
| **90 days**  | 9% |
| **100 days** | 10% |

>!!banner These bonuses are applied when you claim your daily reward. They will expire at the next daily reset (12:00 UTC).

The magic find bonus applies to battles, dungeons, and world bosses. It increases your chances of finding rare items when defeating enemies in these activities.

## Streak Recovery

 If you had a good streak going and lost it, you can recover it, but there are some rules.

| Recovery Details |                                       |
| ---------------- |---------------------------------------|
| Time Window | 48 hours after losing streak          |
| Cost | 300 tokens                            |

## Tips

If you're going to be away, remember that you have almost 24 hours to claim each day's reward. So if the reset is at 12:00 UTC and you usually claim at 14:00 UTC, you could claim tomorrow's as late as 11:59 UTC the next day.
