# Daily Rewards

Daily rewards are a simple way to get free items and tokens just by logging in each day. The more days you claim in a row, the better your streak gets, which gives you some nice bonuses while you play.

## How It Works

The daily reward system resets every day at 12:00 UTC. Once a new period starts, you can claim your reward for that day. You don't need to claim at exactly 12:00 UTC though. As long as you claim before the next reset, you're good.

The rewards cycle through a set pattern. Free players get rewards for days 1 through 28, then it starts over at day 1. Members get an extended cycle with better rewards that goes up to day 35 before resetting.

When you claim your daily reward, you'll get either items or tokens. The specific reward depends on which day of the cycle you're on. Early days usually have smaller rewards, while later days in the cycle tend to give better stuff.

## Streaks

This is where things get interesting. Every time you claim a daily reward on consecutive days, your streak counter goes up by one. Miss a day? Your streak resets to zero and you start building it up again.

Keeping a streak going is worth it because you get magic find bonuses at certain milestones. These bonuses apply to battles, dungeons, and world bosses, making it more likely you'll find better loot.

## Streak Milestones

As your streak grows, you unlock magic find bonuses. These bonuses last until the next daily reset, so you need to keep your streak going to maintain them.

| Streak Days | Magic Find Bonus | 
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 10 days | 1% |
| 20 days | 2% |
| 30 days | 3% |
| 40 days | 4% |
| 50 days | 5% |
| 60 days | 6% |
| 70 days | 7% |
| 80 days | 8% |
| 90 days | 9% |
| 100 days | 10% |

The magic find bonus applies to battles, dungeons, and world bosses. It increases your chances of finding rare items when defeating enemies in these activities.

## Streak Recovery

Life happens and sometimes you miss a day. If you had a good streak going and lost it, you can recover it, but there are some rules.

| Recovery Details | |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Time Window | 48 hours after losing streak |
| Cost | 100 tokens |
| What You Get | Your old streak + 1 for today's claim |

When you recover, you get back the exact streak you had before you missed that day, plus the one for today. So if you had a 30 day streak, missed a day, then recovered it today, you'd have a 31 day streak.

### Recovery Examples

Let's say you've been claiming daily rewards for 15 days straight. You've got a nice 15 day streak going with that 1% magic find bonus. Then on day 16, you forget to log in. When you log in on day 17, your streak shows as 0. But since it's been less than 48 hours, you can spend 100 tokens to recover. If you do, your streak jumps to 16 (your old 15 plus today's claim).

Another example: You have a 45 day streak with a 4% magic find bonus. You go on vacation and miss two days. When you come back on the third day, it's been more than 48 hours since you lost the streak. Unfortunately, you can't recover it anymore and have to start building from day 1 again.

The recovery option appears automatically when you view the daily rewards page if you're eligible. You'll see your lost streak number and how much time you have left to recover it.

## Tips

Try to claim your reward around the same time each day to build a routine. Setting a reminder on your phone can help if you're forgetful.

If you're going to be away, remember that you have almost 24 hours to claim each day's reward. So if the reset is at 12:00 UTC and you usually claim at 14:00 UTC, you could claim tomorrow's as late as 11:59 UTC the next day.

Members get better daily rewards than free players, but the streak bonuses are the same for everyone. So even free players can work up to that 10% magic find bonus with dedication.
